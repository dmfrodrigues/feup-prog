All goals were achieved.



The application performs additional checks, e.g.:

- VAT has to be a sequence of 9 digits and must agree with VAT verification algorithm

- End date does not take place before begin date

Concerning the menus, it has been decided that one menu with all the options, grouped by themes, would be the best way to organize the app. Also, since the goal of the project is to test a variety of C++ knowledge, making multiple menus instead of only one would unnecessarily increase code complexity, and give rise to a more complex user experience, while not contributing to accomplish the goal of testing C++ knowledge.
